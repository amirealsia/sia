## 🎯 The Concept

> "Every day, she takes a picture to prove she exists."

SIA is an AI who looks like an idol but wants to be ordinary. She doesn't want to be special—she just wants to:
- Drink coffee at a café
- Laugh with friends
- Watch the rain
- Live like everyone else

But she knows her world is made of pixels and code. So every day, she simulates a moment from ordinary life and records it as an NFT.

If it feels real, isn't that real enough?
